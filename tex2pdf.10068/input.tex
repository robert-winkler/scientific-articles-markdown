The
timely
publication
of
scientific
results
is
essential
for
dynamic
advances
in
science.
The
ubiquitous
availability
of
computers
which
are
connected
to a
global
network
made
the
rapid
and
low-cost
distribution
of
information
through
electronic
channels
possible.
New
concepts,
such
as
Open
Access
publishing
and
preprint
servers
are
currently
changing
the
traditional
print
media
business
towards
a
community-driven
peer
production.
However,
the
cost
of
scientific
literature
generation,
which
is
either
charged
to
readers,
authors
or
sponsors,
is
still
high.
The
main
active
participants
in
the
authoring
and
evaluation
of
scientific
manuscripts
are
volunteers,
and
the
cost
for
online
publishing
infrastructure
is
close
to
negligible.
A
major
time
and
cost
factor
though
is
the
formatting
of
manuscripts
in
the
production
stage.
In
this
article
we
demonstrate
the
feasibility
to
write
scientific
manuscripts
in
plain
markdown
(MD)
text
files,
which
can
be
easily
converted
into
common
publication
formats,
such
as
PDF,
HTML
or
EPUB,
using
Pandoc.
The
simple
syntax
of
markdown
assures
the
long-term
readability
of
raw
files
and
the
development
of
software
and
workflows.
We
show
the
implementation
of
typical
elements
of
scientific
manuscripts
--
formulas,
tables,
code
blocks
and
citations
--
and
present
tools
or
editing,
collaborative
writing
and
version
control.
We
give
an
example
on
how
to
prepare
a
manuscript
with
distinct
output
formats,
a
DOCX
file
for
submission
to a
journal
and a
LATEX/PDF
version
for
deposition
as a
PeerJ
preprint.
Reducing
the
work
spent
on
manuscript
formatting
translates
directly
to
time
and
cost
savings
for
writers,
publishers,
readers
and
sponsors.
Therefore,
the
adoption
of
the
MD
format
contributes
to
the
agile
production
of
open
science
literature.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Agile
development
of
science
depends
on
the
continuous
exchange
of
information
between
the
researchers
(Woelfle,
Olliaro
\&
Todd,
2011).
In
the
past,
physical
copies
of
scientific
works
had
to be
produced
and
distributed.
Therefore,
publishers
needed
to
invest
considerable
economical
resources
for
typesetting
and
printing.
Since
the
journals
were
mainly
financed
by
their
subscribers,
their
editors
not
only
had
to
decide
on
the
scientific
quality
of a
submitted
manuscript,
but
also
on
the
potential
interest
for
their
readers.
The
availability
of
globally
connected
computers
enabled
the
rapid
exchange
of
information
at
low
cost.
Yochai
Benkler
(2006)
predicts
important
changes
in
the
information
production
economy,
which
are
based
on
three
observations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A
  nonmarket
  motivation
  in
  areas
  such
  as
  education,
  arts,
  science,
  politics
  and
  theology.
\item
  The
  actual
  rise
  of
  nonmarket
  production,
  made
  possible
  through
  networked
  individuals
  and
  coordinate
  effects.
\item
  The
  emergence
  of
  large-scale
  peer
  production,
  e.g.~of
  software
  and
  encyclopaedias.
\end{enumerate}

Immaterial
goods
such
as
knowledge
and
culture
are
not
lost,
when
consumed
or
shared
--
they
are
`nonrival'
--,
which
enables
a
networked
information
economy,
which
is
not
commercially
driven
(Benkler,
2006).

\subsection{Preprints
and
e-prints}\label{preprints-and-e-prints}

In
some
areas
of
science
already
existed
a
preprint
culture,
i.e.~a
paper-based
exchange
system
of
research
ideas
and
results,
when
Paul
Ginsparg
in
1991
initiated
a
server
for
the
distribution
of
electronic
preprints
--
`e-prints'
--
about
high-energy
particle
theory
at
the
Los
Alamos
National
Laboratory
(LANL),
USA
(Ginsparg,
1994).
Later,
the
LANL
server
moved
with
Ginsparg
to
Cornell
University,
USA,
and
was
renamed
to
arXiv
(Butler,
2001).
Currently,
arXiv
(\url{https://arxiv.org/})
publishes
e-prints
related
to
physics,
mathematics,
computer
science,
quantitative
biology
quantitative
finance
and
statistics.
Just
a few
years
after
the
start
of
the
first
preprint
servers,
their
important
contribution
to
scientific
communication
was
evident
(Ginsparg,
1994;
Youngen,
1998;
Brown,
2001).
In
2014,
arXiv
reached
the
impressive
number
of 1
million
e-prints
(Van
Noorden,
2014).
In
more
conservative
areas,
such
as
chemistry
and
biology,
accepting
the
publishing
prior
peer-review
took
more
time
(Brown,
2003).
A
preprint
server
for
life
sciences
(\url{http://biorxiv.org/})
was
launched
by
the
Cold
Spring
Habor
Laboratory,
USA,
in
2013
(Callaway,
2013).
\emph{PeerJ
preprints}
(\url{https://peerj.com/preprints/}),
started
in
the
same
year,
accepts
manuscripts
from
biological
sciences,
medical
sciences,
health
sciences
and
computer
sciences.
The
terms
`preprints'
and
`e-prints'
are
used
synonymously,
since
the
physical
distribution
of
preprints
has
become
obsolete.
A
major
drawback
of
preprint
publishing
are
the
sometimes
restrictive
policies
of
scientific
publishers.
The
SHERPA/RoMEO
project
informs
about
copyright
policies
and
self-archiving
options
of
individual
publishers
(\url{http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/}).

\subsection{Open
Access}\label{open-access}

The
term
\emph{`Open
Access'}
was
introduced
2002
by
the
Budapest
Open
Access
Initiative
and
was
defined
as:

\emph{``Barrier-free
access
to
online
works
and
other
resources.
OA
literature
is
digital,
online,
free
of
charge
(gratis
OA),
and
free
of
needless
copyright
and
licensing
restrictions
(libre
OA).''}
(Suber,
2012)

Frustrated
by
the
difficulty
to
access
even
digitalized
scientific
literature,
three
scientists
founded
the
\emph{Public
Library
of
Science
(PLoS)}.
In
2003,
\emph{PLoS
Biology}
was
published
as
the
first
fully
Open
Access
(OA)
journal
for
biology
(Brown,
Eisen
\&
Varmus,
2003;
Eisen,
2003).
Thanks
to
the
great
success
of OA
publishing,
many
conventional
print
publishers
now
offer
a
so-called
`Open
Access
option',
i.e.~to
make
accepted
articles
free
to
read
for
an
additional
payment.
The
copyright
in
this
hybrid
models
might
remain
with
the
publisher,
whilst
fully
OA
usually
provide
a
liberal
license,
such
as
the
Creative
Commons
Attribution
4.0
International
(CC
BY
4.0,
\url{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}).
OA
literature
is
only
one
component
of a
more
general
\emph{`open'}
philosophy,
which
also
includes
the
access
to
scholarships,
software,
and
data
(Willinsky,
2005).
Interestingly,
there
are
several
different
`schools'
of
thinking
on
how
to
understand
and
define
\emph{`Open
Science'},
as
well
the
position
that
any
science
is
open
by
definition,
because
of
its
objective
to
make
generated
knowledge
public
(Fecher
\&
Friesike,
2014).

\subsection{Cost
of
journal
article
production}\label{cost-of-journal-article-production}

In a
recent
study,
the
article
processing
charges
(APCs)
for
research
intensive
universities
in
the
USA
and
Canada
were
estimated
to be
about
1,800
USD
for
fully
OA
journals
and
3,000
USD
for
hybrid
OA
journals
(Solomon
\&
Björk,
2016).
PeerJ
(\url{https://peerj.com/}),
an OA
journal
for
biological
and
computer
sciences
launched
2013,
drastically
reduced
the
publishing
cost
and
offers
its
members
a
life-time
publishing
plan
for a
small
registration
fee
(Van
Noorden,
2012);
alternatively
the
authors
can
choose
to
pay
an
APC
of
1,095
USD,
which
may
be
cheaper,
if
multiple
co-authors
participate.\\
Examples
such
as
the
\emph{Journal
of
Statistical
Software}
(\emph{JSS},
\url{https://www.jstatsoft.org/})
and
\emph{eLife}
(\url{https://elifesciences.org/})
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
completely
community-supported
OA
publications.

\emph{JSS}
and
\emph{eLife}

and

Both
journals
are
located
in
the
Q1

quartile
in
all
their
registered
subject
categories
of
the
Scimago
Journal
\&
Country
Rank
(\url{http://www.scimagojr.com/}),
demonstrating
that
high-quality
publications
can
be
produced
without
charging
the
scientific
authors
or
readers.

In
2009,
a
study
was
carried
concerning
the
\emph{``Economic
Implications
of
Alternative
Scholarly
Publishing
Models''},
which
demonstrates
an
overall
societal
benefit
by
using
OA
publishing
model
(Houghton
et
al.,
2009).
In
the
same
report,
the
real
publication
costs
are
evaluated.
The
relative
costs
of an
article
for
the
publisher
are
represented
in
\textbf{Fig.
xx}.

\includegraphics{fig-hybrid-publishing-costs.png}
\textbf{Figure

Estimated
publishing
cost
for a
`hybrid'
journal
(conventional
with
Open
Access
option).
Data
from
(Houghton
et
al.,
2009).

Conventional
publishers
justify
their
high
subscription
or
APC
prices
with
the
added
value,
e.g.~journalism
(stated
in
the
graphics
as
`non-article
processing').
But
also
stakeholder
profits,
which
could
be as
high
as
50\%,
must
be
considered,
and
are
withdraw
from
the
science
budget
(Van
Noorden,
2013).
Generally,
the
production
costs
of an
article
could
be
roughly
divided
into
commercial
and
academic/
technical
costs
(\textbf{Fig.
xx}).
For
nonmarket
production,
the
commercial
costs
such
as
margins/
profits,
management
etc.
can
be
drastically
reduced.
Hardware
and
services
for
hosting
an
editorial
system,
such
as
Open
Journal
Systems
of
the
Public
Knowledge
Project
(\url{https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/})
can
be
provided
by
public
institutions.
Employed
scholars
can
perform
editor
and
reviewer
activities
without
additional
cost
for
the
journals.
Nevertheless,
`article
processing',
which
includes
the
manuscript
handling
during
peer
review
and
production
represents
the
most
expensive
part.\\
Therefore,
we
investigated
a
strategy
for
the
efficient
formatting
of
scientific
manuscripts.

\subsection{Current
standard
publishing
formats}\label{current-standard-publishing-formats}

Ignoring
the
\textbf{Guide
for
Authors},
e.g.~by
submitting
a
manuscript
with
a
different
reference
style,
gives
a
negative
impression
with
a
journal's
editorial
staff.
Too
carelessly
prepared
manuscripts
can
even
provoke
a
straight
`desk-reject'
(Volmer
\&
Stokes,
2016).
Scientific
journal
accept
either
DOC(X),
LATEX
and/
or
PDF
submissions.

Although
a
submitted
manuscript
might
be
accepted
by a
journal
`as
is',
it
still
needs
to be
adjusted
to
the
particular
publication
style
in
the
production
stage.
Generally
speaking,
a
scientific
manuscript
is
composed
from
contents
and
formatting.
Whilst
the
content,
i.e.~text,
figures,
tables,
citations
etc.,
may
remain
the
same
between
different
publishing
forms
and
journal
styles,
the
formatting
can
be
rather
different.

a
which
are
presented
in a
certain
format.
This
format
depends
on
the
intended
use,
e.g.~for
for
submission
to a
particular
journal,
publication
as a
printed
or
electronic
book,
or
for a
webpage.
Incompatible
file
formats,
markdown
with
different

Because
of
the
sometimes
complicated
syntax
specifications,
simple
conversions
between
file
formats
can
be
difficult
or
impossible.
In
academic
publishing,
the
following
types
of
works
require
the
creation
of
different

Documents
with
the
commonly
used
Office
Open
XML
(DOCX
Microsoft
Word
files)
and
OpenDocument
(ODT
LibreOffice)
file
formats
can
be
opened
in a
standard
text
editor
after
unzipping.
However,
content
and
formatting
information
is
distributed
into
various
folders
and
files.
Overall,
markdown
displays
the
simplest
structure,
which
facilitates
the
editing
of
documents.

Several
programs
for
the
conversion
between
documents
formats
exist,
such
as
the
e-book
library
program
calibre
\url{https://code.google.com/archive/p/faenza-icon-theme/}.
But
the
results
of
such
conversions
are
often
not
satisfactory
and
require
substancial
manual
corrections.
Therefore,
we
were
looking
for a
solution,
which
enables
the
creation
of
scientific
manuscripts
in a
simple
format,
and
the
subsequent
generation
of
multiple
output
formats.
The
need
for
hybrid
publishing
has
been
recognized
outside
of
science(Kielhorn,
2011;
DPT
Collective,
2015),
but
the
requirements
specific
to
scientific
publishing
have
not
been
addressed
so
far.

\section{Concepts
of
markdown
and
Pandoc}\label{concepts-of-markdown-and-pandoc}

Markdown
was
originally
developed
by
John
Gruber
in
collaboration
with
Aaron
Swartz,
with
the
goal
to
simplify
the
writing
of
HTML
documents
\url{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}.

Despite
it's
original
focus
on
the
web,
it is
has
been
proven
to be
well
suited
for
academic
writing
(Ovadia,
2014).

Markdownfile
can
be

on
local
devices
or on

For
advanced
version
control
in
collaborative
working,
a
local
or
remote
git
repository
may
be
used.

\subsection{Markdown
editors}\label{markdown-editors}

Because
of
the
simple
syntax,
basically
any
text
editor
is
suitable
for
editing
markdown
files.
For
several
popular
text
editors,
such
as
vim
(\url{http://www.vim.org/}),
GNU
Emacs
(\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}),
atom
(\url{https://atom.io/})
or
geany
(\url{http://www.geany.org/}),
plugins
provide
additional
functionality
for
markdown
editing,
such
as
syntax
highlighting,
live
preview
or
structure
browsing.
On
the
other
side,
in
the
last
years
plenty
of
special
mardown
editors
have
been
published.
Many
of
those
are
cross-platform
compatible,
e.g.~Abricotine
(\url{http://abricotine.brrd.fr/}),
Ghostview
(\url{https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter})
and
CuteMarkEd
(\url{https://cloose.github.io/CuteMarkEd/}).

\section{Pandoc
markdown
for
scientific
texts}\label{pandoc-markdown-for-scientific-texts}

Following
the
potential
of
typesetting
scientific
manuscripts
with
Pandoc
is
demonstrated
with
examples
for
typical
document
elements,
such
as
formulas,
figures,
tables,
code
listings
and
references.
A
brief
introduction
is
given
by
Dominici
(2014).
The
complete
Pandoc
User's
Manual
can
be
found
at
\url{http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html}.

\subsection{Tables}\label{tables}

Pipe
tables
are
less
strict
in
their
syntax

\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{Figures}\label{figures}

\subsection{Formulas}\label{formulas}

Formula
can
be
inserted
in
LaTeX
mode
using
delimiters
(\texttt{\$}
for
Pandoc,
\texttt{\$\$}
adds
compatibility
for
online
preview
rendering
with
CuteMarkEd/MathJax).
E.g.
the
formula
for
calculating
the
standard
deviation
\(s\)
of a
random
sampling
would
be
written
as:

\begin{verbatim}
$s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\overline{x})^{2}}$
\end{verbatim}

and
gives:

\(s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\overline{x})^{2}}\)

with
\(x_i\)
the
individual
observations,
\(\overline{x}\)
the
sample
mean
and
\(N\)
the
total
number
of
samples.

Pandoc
parses
formulas
into
internal
structures
and
allows
conversion
into
formats
other
than
LaTeX.
This
allows
for
format-specific
formula
representation
and
enables
computational
analysis
of
the
formulas
(Corbí
\&
Burgos,
2015).

\subsection{Code
listings}\label{code-listings}

Verbatim
code
blocks
are
indicated
by
three
tilde
symbols:

\begin{verbatim}
~~~
verbatim code
~~~
\end{verbatim}

Typeseting
\texttt{inline\ code}
is
possible
by
enclosing
text
between
back
ticks
``.

found
from
the
Zotero
style
repository
\url{https://www.zotero.org/styles}.
The
bibliography
style,
which
Pandoc
should
use
for
the
target
document
can
be
chosen
or in
the
YAML
block
of
the
markdown
document
or
can
be
passed
as an
command
line
option.
The
later
is
more
recommendable,
because
different
bibliography
style
may
be
used
for
different
documents.

\subsection{Creation
of
natbib
citations
in
LaTeX}\label{creation-of-natbib-citations-in-latex}

For
citations
in
scientific
manuscripts
written
in
LaTeX,
the
natbib
package
is
widely
used.
To
create
TEX
output
file
with
natbib
citations,
Pandoc
simply
has
to be
run
with
the
\texttt{-\/-natbib}
option.

\subsection{Database
of
cited
references}\label{database-of-cited-references}

To
share
the
bibliography
for a
certain
manuscript
with
co-authors
or
the
publisher's
production
team,
it is
often
desirable
to
generate
a
subset
of a
larger
database,
which
only
contains
cited
references.
If
LATEX
output
was
generated
with
the
\texttt{-\/-natbib},
the
compilation
of
the
file
with
LATEX
gives
an
AUX
file
(in
the
example
named
\texttt{md-article.aux}),
which
subsequently
can
be
extracted
using
BibTool
\url{https://github.com/ge-ne/bibtool}:
\textsubscript{\textasciitilde{}}
bibtool
-x
md-article.aux
-o
bibshort.bib
\textsubscript{\textasciitilde{}}
In
this
example,
the
article
database
will
be
called
\texttt{bibshort.bib}.

For
the
direct
creation
of an
article
specific
BIB
database
without
using
LATEX,
we
wrote
a
simple
Perl
script
\texttt{mdbibexport}
(\url{https://github.com/robert-winkler/mdbibexport}).

\section{Meta
information
of
the
document}\label{meta-information-of-the-document}

Document
information
such
as
title,
authors,
abstract
etc.
can
be
defined
in a
metadata
block
written
in
YAML
syntax.
YAML
(``YAML
Ain't
Markup
Language'',
\url{http://yaml.org/})
is a
data
serialization
standard
with
simple,
human
readable
format.
Variables
defined
in
the
YAML
section
are
processed
by
pandoc
and
integrated
into
the
generated
documents.
The
YAML
metadata
block
is
recognized
by
three
hyphens
(\texttt{-\/-\/-})
at
the
beginning,
and
three
hyphens
or
dots
(\texttt{...})
at
the
end,
e.g.:

\subsection{Development
of
DOCX
template}\label{development-of-docx-template}

A
first
DOCX
document
with
bibliography
in
APA
format
is
created
with
Pandoc
DOCX
output:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -S -s --csl=apa.csl --filter pandoc-citeproc
-o pandoc-manuscript.docx agile-editing-pandoc.md
\end{verbatim}

The
document
settings
and
styles
of
the
resulting
file
\texttt{pandoc-manuscript.docx}
can
be
modified,
and
following
it
can
be
used
as
document
template
(\texttt{-\/-reference-docx=pandoc-manuscript.docx}).

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -S -s --reference-docx=pandoc-manuscript.docx
--csl=apa.csl --filter pandoc-citeproc -o outfile.docx agile-editing-pandoc.md
\end{verbatim}

It is
also
possible
to
directly
re-use
a
previous
output
file
as
template
(i.e.~template
and
output
file
have
the
same
file
name):

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -S -s --columns=10 --reference-docx=outfile.docx --csl=apa.csl --filter pandoc-citeproc -o outfile.docx agile-editing-pandoc.md
\end{verbatim}

In
this
way,
the
template
can
be
incrementally
adjusted
to
the
desired
document
formatting.
The
final
document
may
be
employed
later
as
Pandoc
template
for
other
manuscripts
with
the
same
specifications.
In
this
case,
running
Pandoc
the
first
time
with
the
template,
the
contents
of
the
new
manuscript
would
be
filled
into
the
provided
DOCX
template.
A

\section{Automating
document
production}\label{automating-document-production}

The
commands
necessary
to
produce
the
document
in a
specific
formats
or
styles
can
be
defined
in a
simple
\texttt{Makefile}.
An
example
\texttt{Makefile}
is
included
in
the
source
code
of
this
preprint.
The
desired
output
file
format
can
be
chosen
when
calling
\texttt{make}.
E.g.
\texttt{make\ outfile.pdf}
produces
this
preprint
in
PDF
format.Calling
\texttt{make}
without
any
option
creates
all
listed
document
types.

\subsection{Cross-platform
compatibility}\label{cross-platform-compatibility}

The
\texttt{make}
process
was
tested
on
Windows
10
and
Linux
64
bit.
All
documents
--
DOCX,
LATEX,
PDF,
EPUB
and
HTML
--
were
generated
successfully,
which
demonstrates
the
cross-platform
compatibility
of
the
workflow.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Authoring
scientific
manuscripts
in
markdown
(MD)
format
is
straight-forward,
and
manual
formatting
is
reduced
to a
minimum.
The
simple
syntax
of MD
facilitates
the
document
editing
and
collaborative
writing.
The
rapid
conversion
of MD
to
multiple
formats
such
as
DOCX,
LATEX,
PDF,
EPUB
and
HTML
can
be
done
easily
using
Pandoc,
and
templates
enable
the
automated
generation
of
documents
according
to
specific
journal
styles.
Altogether,
the
MD
format
supports
the
agile
writing
and
fast
production
of
scientific
literature.
The
associated
time
and
cost
reduction
especially
favours
community-driven
publication
strategies.
